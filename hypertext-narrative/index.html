        <summary>Death Note Summary (Spoiler Alert!!)</summary>
        <p>In a world where the feeling of being lonely amongst a crowd is prevalent, a guy named Light Yagami stumbles upon an odd black book, the Death Note which belongs to a Shinigami- a God of Death. The death note has the power to end lives if the name of a person is written in it while looking at him/her. The Shinigami that owns this death note has dropped it on purpose in order to see how the mortals will use it and what happens next becomes a series that stays with you, days after watching it. After a few days of getting the Death Note, Light is visited by Ryuk and he cannot be seen by anyone except the one who has touched the Death Note. Ryuk reveals the reason for dropping the note and it turns out to be nothing but boredom. Following these events, we come to see the various reports about the death of a number of criminals around the world. The cause of death is extremely vague as the criminals around the world are perishing due to heart-attacks and accidents and the media terms the deaths to be planned by a single mastermind, Kira, which literally translates to killer in Japanese. The law enforcement agencies and the public cozied up to Kira but the Interpol looks out for the assistance of L, an enigmatic and highly esteemed detective. L tracks down Kira stage a TV broadcast and tracks down Light Yagami to be in the Kanto region of Japan. Light is infuriated by this and vows to kill L as he is a hindrance to the execution of his plans and whilst all this L is trying to piece everything and determines that Light Yagami is the prime suspect. Graduation comes along for Light and after school is over Light is inducted into Kira Task Force set up by L. The story takes a turn.that changes the perception of the people as the crime rate around the world has dropped significantly and cults have been established with people who are patrons of Kira. Potential successors of L are revealed: Near and Mello. They are aware of Ls death and deduce that Light Yagami to be the prime suspect. The story continues with the plotline explanation which is done minimalistically but closes all the loopholes and loose ends of the story. The narrative is extremely precise and character arcs are totally justified by the end of the series. Years pass and the new Kira appears who is simply on a killing spree, consequently, the people find the new Kira to be “boring” and monotonous. The attention-seeking traits of this Kira are evident and is a turn off for the public that revered the former Kira. Ryuk looks at all this and tells Midora that no other human will supersede Light as the new Kira. </p>
